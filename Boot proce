Turn on the pc
If there is a failure during POST (power-on self-test) it wont boot up
Initialize the BIOS (BIOS has the initialize order, info of all hardware, ...)
BIOS loads and run the boot code from the first sector of hardware (/bios)
The bootloader, known Grub2, loads/call the kernel into the memory
Kernel is executing. After loaded it will split in 2 parts (two-stages boot)
Two-stages boot, first part is the initrd (initial ram disk). The / it will be mounted.
Two-stages boot, second part init (/sbin/init) sets up the user space and the
processes needed for the user environment. The init functions calls the systemd daemon.
The systemd is responsible for bringing the linux host to a usable state.
Systemd is responsible for mounting file systems, starting and managing system services. 
systemd is common but we have the systemV (used in RHEL6, CenyOS6 distros)
